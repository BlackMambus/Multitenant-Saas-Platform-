# Multitenant-Saas-Platform-

This project focuses on building a scalable and secure software-as-a-service (SaaS) architecture that supports multiple clients (“tenants”) from a single codebase and infrastructure. Each tenant has its own data, configuration, and user base—ensuring isolation while benefiting from shared resources, streamlined updates, and lower operational costs.

It’s the ideal model for SaaS providers serving multiple organizations with similar needs (think: CRM systems, project management apps, e-learning platforms).

🎯 Goals
Create tenant-aware architecture with data and resource isolation

Enable tenant-specific customizations (branding, features, permissions)

Support horizontal scalability for onboarding unlimited tenants

Simplify deployment and CI/CD with centralized control

Implement tenant-level analytics and billing

🧱 Core Components
Tenant Manager: Onboards new tenants with domain mapping and configuration

Authentication Layer: Role-based access control across tenants using OAuth2/JWT

Database Design: Shared vs isolated schema (e.g., row-level tenant tagging or separate DBs)

Theming Engine: Supports per-tenant branding and UI personalization

Subscription & Billing Module: Handles pricing plans and usage-based billing

Admin Dashboard: For tenant management, user provisioning, logs, and metrics.
